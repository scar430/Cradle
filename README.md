# Cradle
Cradle works as the core of your server, aiming to build on the Vanilla-Spigot experience and increase the quality-of-life of both the server owner and the player.
Currently Cradle is in the most early stages of development; expect lots of changes.

# Developer's Note
- Using the Cradle Economy module is not suggested as economy data will NOT permeate through restarts.
- RTP module does NOT work.
- Permissions module does NOT work.
