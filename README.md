# What is Cradle?
Cradle works as the core of your server, aiming to build on the Vanilla-Spigot experience and increase the quality-of-life of both the server owner and the player.
Currently Cradle is in the most early stages of development; expect lots of changes.

# Specifications
- Cradle requires [Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault) to interface with other plugins. If you're wondering why things like prefixes aren't showing up, make sure [Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault) is installed.
- Cradle is compatible with MineCraft versions 1.8 - 1.16, note that older versions require further testing.
- Cradle requires Java 8 or higher, older versions may cause weird behavior.

# Developer's Note
- Using the Cradle Economy module is not suggested as economy data will NOT permeate through restarts.
- RTP module does NOT work.
- Permissions module does NOT work.
